              <p class="project-label">For this exam project I have chosen to create a website for the Bose company, more specifically for the Bose Sleep Buds, a type of earphones they sell for customers that encounter problems with their sleep schedule, stress, insomnia, or different noises such as neighborsâ€™ fuss. Also, these earphones are unique, because they do not stream music, podcasts or anything else as the usual earphones do, they only stream the content from the Bose Sleep App. They are special, innovative and worth having a website about them.</p>

             <p class="project-info">I focused on young adults aged between 18-34 years. When conducting Qualitative Interviews I took into consideration the product, how important would it be for the user, to get to know afterwards what to include in the website, to make an informative campaign which would impress users when navigating on the website.</p>

This color palette conveys a calm mood nocturnal atmosphere. All of these were proven by the users when I did the Usability Testing.</p>

             <p class="project-info">I tried to make this solution concise, good looking but at the same time useful for the customers. If talking about improvements, I could work more on real time experience design (text should be comfortable for users to read), on research (focus more on the solution rather than on product), on coding (learning more of the syntaxis).</p>
